## Python Signal and System Processing Toolbox

This repository provides a collection of Python scripts and modules for various signal and system processing tasks. It's designed to be a practical resource for researchers, engineers, and students working with signals and systems.

**FEATURES:**

**Signal Generation and Manipulation:**

  - Create common signals like sinusoids, ramps, steps, and impulses.
  - Apply time-domain manipulations like shifting, scaling, and addition.
    
**Fourier Transforms:**

  - Implement Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency analysis.
  - Convert between time and frequency domains.
  - Visualize the frequency content of signals using magnitude and phase plots.
    
**Filtering:**
  - Design and apply various filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop) using digital filter techniques.
  - Filter signals to remove noise or extract specific frequency components.
    
**Convolution:**

  - Perform convolution operations to model system response and signal filtering.
  - Sampling and Quantization:
  - Simulate the effects of sampling and quantization on signal quality and information fidelity.
    
**System Analysis:**

  - Implement tools for analyzing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, including impulse response and frequency response.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x (Recommended: 3.7 or later)
NumPy (https://numpy.org/)
SciPy (https://scipy.org/)
Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) (optional, for visualizations)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/carsonomao/SIGNALS-AND-SYSTEMS-USING-PYTHON.git
   
2. Install required dependencies: pip install numpy scipy matplotlib  # (if using for visualizations)

**Usage:**

Each module within the repository offers specific functionalities. You can either import and utilize these modules within your own Python scripts or leverage the provided Jupyter Notebook examples.
